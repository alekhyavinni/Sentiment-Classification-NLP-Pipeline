370,1,"I came here to try out some tacos.  The tacos average in price about $5 each.  They have different sauces that you can put on your tacos.   I tried the pork tacos.  While it wasn't bad, it wasn't memorable either.  

This place is located inside and there are other businesses inside as well.  It was hot and stuffy.  The restaurant wasn't the cleanest either.  

Overall, it was just ok.  A bit cheaper than the more famous place across the street."
147,2,"It was fantastic, I got the signature taco and oh man it was so good. everything about it was amazing, the hot sauce on the side that they give out with your taco is really good also! I highly recommend this place!"
387,2,"After the first bite of the carnitas taco I ordered, I wanted to put it down and apologize to the chef for all the times I made carnitas at home. What the hell was I thinking? How could I dare to think I had the right to make carnitas when this miracle existed?

I've been back a few more times and ordered more items on the menu. Everything I've had is great. Everything is made fresh right in front of you and the ingredients are all at peak yumminess, down to the chopped white onions at the toppings station. 

Hot tip: come here after 10:30pm on Fridays and Saturdays for their special late night menu. They serve up a few different varieties of tortas (basically subs) that feature a generous helping of meat, cheese (if you're into that sort of thing), and guacamole at no extra charge (I'm looking at you, Chipotle). They have a hot dog and egg torta that has absolutely no business being as good as it is. I watched the chef whisk the eggs, chop up the hot dog and cook it all up on the flat top. The eggs were fluffy as hell and the flavours mixed together into a masterpiece that Imran N. and I couldn't believe. 

So yeah. Go here, be polite and get the best damn Mexican food in the city."
539,1,"It was fun get together at Mariachis last week when me and my friends decided to go here. 
We primarily wanted to try the spicy margaritas. We got the jalepeno cucumber pitcher and the spicy pineapple one. Both were delicious. They got us the frozen style margaritas and I am not sure if they have the on the rocks option. 

During summer they have seating outside which is a small space with quite a few tables in the area. A decent place to sit, however it can get crowded. The place is located on the main road so it's easily accessed. 

We ordered food chicken fajita and our friends got the enchiladas. The fajita were a bit too saucy and wasn't really crisp. We also got some guacamole and that was delicious. So foodwise it was so-so but for drinks it was a really fun place to be!"
1875,1,"Came to Lai Wah Heen with my family to try out their peking duck as I had received a coupon for a free order. Growing up in Scarborough and being completely surrounded by Chinese restaurants, and being Chinese myself, I've had my fair share of Chinese cuisine. Upon arrival, I knew right away it would be a different vibe as it was located inside a hotel and everything looked fairly nice. 

The staff was helpful and polite though a bit stiff. Nonetheless our order was accurate and the tea was always filled. We had dinner on a Tuesday night so it wasn't overly busy but there were some larger parties dining.

On to the food: so as I said, I'm Chinese and have grown up around eating this food in and outside of the house. We ordered about 9 dishes for 7 people including peking duck, stir-fried beef flavoured with aged mandarin peel, sweet and sour pork w/ lychee, gailon vegetables, pineapple chicken fried rice, soy sauce fried rice noodle with beef and fried chicken. First impressions, the food looked nice but was pretty small portions and cost a pretty penny more than what you get uptown. Not surprising with this being a downtown hotel restaurant. The taste though was really really good. Everything was delicious and had lots of flavour. Presentation was pretty and at the end we ordered enough to feel full though not without a price. 

Overall, the food was delicious, the service was good but price for the amount of food was just a bit too much for myself. They are other options out there for upscale Chinese food that might possibly be less expensive and closer to my neck of the woods."
82,0,"Ok, so I know this place is all the rage. 

I ordered the grilled beef for corona takeaway and I was disgusted. There was more fat, cartilage and inedible pieces than beef. Chew chew CRUNCH - spit. Over and over. My friend called me two hours later after ordering the same thing - she ended up giving her order to the homeless after the first bite. 

This means that they either don't clean (cut the meat) properly, or using cheaper pieces to save a buck. 

The grilled chicken was dry too. Honestly though, the shrimp was good. Stick to pulled beef and chicken for authenticity and - TEXTURE. C'mon seven lives!

Very disappointed."
871,0,The food was just horrible. The food was bland and the servers told us to try dishes that did not taste well
295,0,"Had an appointment across the street so I saw this Mexican place and decided to try it out. It's very nicely decorated -- vibrant colours, a mural, and lots of Mexican decor. 

I decided to go with a veggie burrito as I am vegetarian, which came up to $9 flat. I was told at the cash that it's 10% off if you pay with cash (not sure if that's an everyday thing but at least I know for next time). Anyways, I was served right away and I was in and out within five minutes I'd say. The burrito itself was not the greatest--pretty bland compared to other veggie burritos I've eaten (and I eat a lot of them lol). I've also never had a burrito with broccoli, cauliflower and carrots in it so this was a first for me . Honestly tasted like I had some type of Asian stirfry in my burrito which really threw me off. Guacamole is supposed to be included but I couldn't even taste it . To be honest I didn't finish a quarter the burrito because I just didn't enjoy it at all. A piece of the cauliflower actually fell on the ground by accident there was a bunch of pigeons around me that really enjoyed it lol  

Would I come back? Probably not. If I was in the area I'd be open to trying something else on the menu because I see a lot of great reviews but I don't see myself ever coming out of my way to come here again."
1794,0,Cockroaches running around.  This place is very dirty and the food isn't nice.  I would not recommend unless you are asking for a stomach ache.
296,0,Can't comment on the food as I NEVER GOT MY ORDER. I ordered a shrimp burrito and waited 30 minutes. I had an appointment so I couldn't wait anymore; I asked the cashier if my order was almost ready and after looking through a pile of past orders I saw him throw the shrimp on the grill. I asked them to forget about it as really had to go. They reimbursed me cash and I left annoyed that I never ate my food and was starving. I'm not sure how they somehow forgot about my order when I was sitting right there in front of them waiting for 30 minutes! I don't think I'll give it another shot...
1530,1,"5/5 venue. Super clean (even the washrooms) for a Chinatown establishment and beautiful interior design -- traditional Beijing palace style! Super cool place to take a date or someone not so familiar with the Chinese culture for an ""authentic"" experience.......

But 3/5 food. Why? No major flaws with taste or quality, but unfortunately the dishes are just kind of boring. The regional cuisine served here is northeastern Chinese, which is my specialty since I hail from Shandong, as do the owner and some of the staff! I find the dishes very clean in that I feel that 98 Aroma uses less corn starch, oil, sodium, and possibly MSG than many other Chinatown restaurants.

3/5 value. Portion sizes are reasonable, but don't expect anything huge that would last for a week for under $10 like at House of Gourmet, etc. Pricier than most Chinese restaurants, but 98 Aroma can get away with this since they do have a swankier and more fusion feel. Think R&D, but with more Chinese-influence. A good place to take your Caucasian coworkers or in-laws, but not to dine alone just because. 

A few notes about specific dishes-

1. I've had the soups here before and the Hot & Sour soup is actually a huge portion even as a small size. The delicate mushrooms soup is not as substantial, so cannot stand alone as a meal.

2. Do order the Summer Breeze Veggie Salad (vegan) -- and make sure you MIX it well as all the sauce (and flavor) is at the bottom of the bowl. $9.99. Big portion, enough to share between 2 people or have as a lighter meal. I loved the textures and glass noodles.

3. Very mediocre Assorted Delicate Veggies (vegan). Broccoli, celery, carrots, and fried tofu. $14.99. Way too basic.

4. My gfs had the scallion pancakes, which looked more cooked and crispier than the ones my mom makes at home, but gfs enjoyed these. 

5. Can't remember the menu name, but gfs ordered a huge ass chicken udon stew, which was massive. They really liked the chicken and flavors here. 

6. Fried green beans with minced beef -- beans were oily and gfs weren't a fan. $13.99.

They take credit, debit cards at no extra charge. We didn't make a reservation for 7PM on a Friday night and were seated immediately, so customer volume is definitely not as high as it used to be a year ago.

Overall, would return, but only with Chinese food novices or for a special occasion."
1532,2,"In Chinatown, there is a plethora of Asian dining options to choose from. Recently, I had the opportunity to check out the newly opened 98 Aroma where they offer refined Northern Chinese cuisine. The prices are higher than some of the neighboring establishments, so I highly recommend going with a group of 3-5 people to offset the costs. This way, you can order several dishes to share, as most plates are served with generous portion sizes and are meant for sharing. 

The outside may look unassuming, but the interior was designed to replicate traditional Chinese decor with its elaborate wood ornaments, and Asian-inspired craft works. The dimly lit restaurant sets a very relaxing ambiance, and there are several private booths available along with tables.  

The menu consisted of several popular Northern Chinese dishes like dumplings, scallion pancakes, and spicy seafood and beef dishes. Most of Northern Chinese dishes are characterized by its bold flavors, and dishes are served in big portions. So, you can expect both at 98 Aroma. My friend and I started off with the refreshing Summer Breeze Salad ($9.99) - a colorful mixture of sweet-potato noodles, julienne leeks, bell-peppers, red cabbage, radishes, onions, and carrots with a sweet vinaigrette. 

Northern Chinese cuisine is very wheat-based, so I had to order the Pan Fried Pork and Chives Dumplings ($9.99), which was very good. The crispy potstickers were filled with a generous amount of pork, and the chives gave it a nice aroma after being pan fried. 

Next up was their signature dish, the Steamed Tilapia with Chopped Bell Chilies ($29.99) - the dish arrived in a considerable sized bowl with the bone-in tilapia slathered in a rich yet spicy sauce. The fish was juicy and flaky, and the chili-based sauce complemented it beautifully. However, there were just way too many bones, so be extra careful when eating. 

I enjoyed the crispy texture of the Fried Salt and Pepper Calamari ($15.99), and it was perfectly spiced. 

Out of all the dishes, my least favorite was the Signature Chicken Wings ($15.99). Pricewise, it's pretty expensive for wings, and it was lacking in flavor. The peppers were sporadically spread out to the side, so it wasn't spiced very well.

Overall, I had an enjoyable dining experience at 98 Aroma. The restaurant was bustling with customers that Friday evening, and I thought that the wait staff did a good job of handling the customer service. Since they are a new establishment, there were two new waiters on staff training around that time. They were relatively slow, but it's understandable since they're new. 98 Aroma is a welcome addition to the area as they offer a more refined take on Chinese food, and is sure to please the people in the area looking for a nice place to dine."
739,2,Great place with such a cozy ambiance! We sat at the bar and enjoyed some of the best ribeye steak I ever had! My husband got the Caccio e Peppe! The ribeye was seasoned perfectly and the salad that came with us was perfect! I wish I was staying in Toronto long enough to eat here again!
826,0,"Absolutely terrible food and even worse attitude and service. 

Didn't even have a bite of the food"
810,1,"I have frequently gone by this restaurant, and was curious to try it out. I dined here for a business meeting with several of my colleagues.

The ambiance and decor is elegant and romantic overall, and the staff are very welcoming and hospitable.

Carisma has been an establishment in Toronto for years, and I was eager to try it out based on recommendations.

Upon entering, I was greeted by very hospitable staff. The restaurant was entirely empty upon my arrival, which I found to be unusual given that it was peak dinner time.

Our server was attentive and knowledgeable and had great recommendations about specials that evening and the menu. 

My colleague and I decided to share the Grilled Calamari appetizer, which was quite flavorful in nature with the addition of olives and herbs. Although I didn't partake in the bread, my colleague mentioned that it was quite soft and delicious overall!

For our entrees, we ordered the SeaBass Filet which according to my companion was well-seasoned and delicious overall; another colleague asked for a 'surprise' entree and was presented with a combined dish of the gnocchi and agnolotti, which she enjoyed. My entree was the ahi tuna dish which I was excited about; however, I must admit that this was overdone. It was presented as an entire tuna steak, which was likely the issue in the cook overall, as had it been sliced tuna, there may have been more control over the cook. I had asked for it to be rare, and it was far more than well-done, and even charred on one side. 

Overall, I am glad that I tried this establishment. I commend the staff and service for their efforts."
950,0,"I can't believe there are such high ratings for 7 numbers. I had high expectations for this place before coming due to the reviews. But it was about a 2.5 imho.

Shared the following with hubby...

Arugula salad with red pepper and goat cheese $12
- This was the best dish of the evening (sad isn't it? It was just a salad). I liked it as the goat cheese was part of the dressing. The red pepper was delish but wish the portion was bigger. A tad small for $12

Veal Lasagne - Lasagne with fresh-made pasta sheets, fresh ground veal, mozzarella, and housemade sauce $12.75 (large)
- Our friends ordered a small variation of this and honestly perhaps we should have ordered the small as well. It looked around the same size except it was on a slightly larger plate. There was too much pasta and sauce and too little meat. My friend called her small bowl a snack size pasta. Very saucy. That ""homemade"" sauce seems to make a repeat with a lot of dishes... But it wasn't that impressive. Tasted like something from a can. 

Meatballs - Big meatballs stuffed with mozzarella, smothered in sauce $13
- I didn't like this at all and let my hubby eat most of it. There was only a small pinky tip size mozzarella bit in it. Wasn't even served hot. Way too much sauce. I ended up dipping bread with it.

As for service, the server who served us was very polite but the general manager Tom? (glasses with plaid shirt) was super rude. Three people could not attend last minute and he said something like if I had known, I would have removed this table long ago (they attached another small table to one end). I think he could have handled the situation a lot better. Thanks for denting the mood of a friend's birthday. We noticed Tom kept giving our table dirty looks as well. At least the food came pretty quickly and our server always made sure things were ok. 

Not coming back again. No one was full and we got wings afterwards."
1856,1,"What did I just eat? lol
I tried their Famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian. It's a random mix of everything. It has a lot of vegetables (potato, mushrooms, carrots, zucchini, egg & tomato) if you want a healthier option. For me, it's not a lot of meat, a smaller portion and not very filling. The hand pulled noodles were good, the right texture, but again not enough quantity."
549,0,"We went with my children to this restaurant and the service was good but the food was mediocre and heavily priced for the value. I ordered a cheese melt, and got more sausage than cheese and the cheese was cheddar (this dish is not done with cheddar). For $40 dollars per person without alcoholic beverages, one would expect so much more. It was 7 pm and the place was empty. Very disappointed. We won't go back!"
1297,1,"Sort of an overhyped ice cream shop.

They indeed offer unique flavours, but it's significantly more expensive than necessary. Their flavours are fun to try if you haven't been here, but I would probably never return with their exuberant prices. Two tiny scoops of ice cream can run you nearly $10. You can find plenty of ice cream shops with unique flavours for way less.
Their ice cream is also super melty as well. As soon as I got it, it was already melting all over the place. If you're into soft serve, this is your spot--but I'm a hard serve ice cream kind of person."
1763,1,"Food was tasty.

Eyelash found in tripe dish.

Guy tried to give us leftovers.

Prices are not available unless you ask. FYI here are the prices."
692,2,"I have been wanting to come to this spot since my last visit to Toronto based on their offerings, the Yelp reviews and pictures. Today was the day. 

The location is a bit strange behind an office building where you need to enter into the office building to get to the cafe. Once you are there the service is very attentive, the food is wonderful and really authentic. The seating area is very quiet and just a refreshing break from the congestion of the city. 

I took my sister and brother in law who are locals and they will be back often based on our experience.

Thank you for starting our day with a joyfully experience."
566,2,"I really like this place. It is bright and clean. The food is good and the service is great. There are two shortfalls; no fish tacos, no liquor license. I always get refritos, guacamole, and tacos al pastor. Al pastor is always missing the Pineapple but is good nonetheless. This place needs to serve beer, una cerveza por favor!"
314,1,"I forgot, the second time I went, how bad the green curry is and got it again.  Damn it."
555,2,"This year has really started off well for me (at least in terms of food haha)

King Tacos is a family-run Mexican restaurant on St. Clair West. We ordered Gaucamole, Chicken Tacos and Beef Bistec Tacos. 

You do get free fresh chips and sauces with all orders, which I think is super! 

The whole concept is amazing. You get FRESH tacos in a taco box, you assemble it yourself, which I think is nice. You also get 3 different sauces to add to your tacos and you can add cheese too! 

It's very authentic and similar to how it is in Mexico! It's quite a large restaurant with lots of seating. The only thing I would say it as it's family run, it's a little slow. They're definitely hospitable and friendly but the service is a little slow, even for a weekend lunch. I won't ding them for this because the flavours of everything we ordered was scrumptious. Large portions don't hurt either ;)"
1634,1,"The service was great, but the quality of the food was pretty mediocre. Tried 4 different kinds of dumplings - neither of them were bad, but didn't stand out either."
1435,0,"Just prepared that you may wait more than 50 mins for food serving. i came here twice. each time me and my friends will waiting more than 50 mins for food after we ordered. no matter how many customers in here. they are always very slow. even fried rice, they will take that long.

And the fried rice. Are not totally sauced... even it took 50 mins to make."
1103,1,"Super average food with inflated prices. It's a small place so you have to make reservations even on a week night. 
The veggie pasta that I got (linguine with cream sauce and mushrooms) costed me 20 bucks without tax. The pasta was al dente which I liked but lacked much flavour. The portion size on the other hand was big. 
The calamari was also around $20 but was well cooked. I just wish we got more pieces :( They charred it nicely but by the time it made it to our table it was cold. 
The sever talked super fast but was friendly and happy. Not sure if I will return because I wasn't impressed with anything!"
1612,2,"This is a restaurant meant for dining in large groups. The food is delicious and good quality seafood, with large quantities, depending on the option you choose. One thing to keep in mind is that the menu options are a bit on the higher budget scale, but the portions are quite good. The highlight dishes are the lobster tower, crab tower, and deep fried oysters.

Make sure to call in advance and reserve a table."
1135,1,"A decent spot for family style Italian food. The food is not very exquisite but doesn't taste too bad either. Pasta was great but other dishes were just okay. 

Beef carpaccio: very salty and oily. Part of the beef tasted frozen. There was also a sharp bitter taste in the bites. It's supposed to be made with truffle oil but I couldn't taste any truffle.  

Veal piccata: very mediocre family style dish 

Smoke duck angelhair: the pasta was very delicious! Perfectly cooked and favoured with lots of toppings. The smoke duck was delicious too."
360,2,"I live in Chicago and I'm spoiled with delicious Mexican food, so this place blew my mind. 

The sauces are amazing. If they sold them I would've brought a few bottles back with me. I had the taco bowl with chorizo and the choriqueso.  Both were beyond amazing. The chorizo is the best chorizo I ever had in my life."
1750,1,"Spinich garlic shrimp was great. Beef shu mai was a little salty. Sour and sweet pork was too dry and hard to chew, so they replaced it with sour and sweet chicken.  It is cash only!"
479,1,"Would give the drinks a 4/5. Extremely slow wait (~14 minutes to get our drinks). Also asked to remove agave from one of our drinks and the waiter did not communicate that properly to his bar tender - so we got stuck with agave in one of our drinks even though we asked to remove it. 

Not worth the wait. Take your business elsewhere. Did not try the food so I can't give any insight to that."
991,1,"We came to Grazie for dinner on a Friday evening. It was half empty when we came in (around 4:45), but it was packed by 6pm. Honestly, I expected food to be better based on all the reviews, however it wasn't spectacular food! Service was fine (when it wasn't busy), ambience was traditional but very noisy (perhaps because restaurant is small and packed with people). 

I don't know if I'll return to try again as would like to explore other restaurants around."
1760,0,"Worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant! 
The service was so slow; we got our food after exactly one hour. Also, the server didn't speak English, was aggressive, and had an attitude. 
Moreover, the food was served colder than usual and was extra oily. 
We tried to address the issue to the manager but he said: ""it's okay"". 
I don't recommend even giving this restaurant a try!"
541,0,"Went there on a Sat night at 6pm for dinner before a movie.  
On the plus side the service was reasonably good.  
On the minus side:
1. The prices were much higher than the menu on their website.  This was misleading.
2. The food was small in both flavour and quantity.  

There are far better Mexican restaurants in the area."
550,1,Super expensive for small portions. Good wait staff and very friendly. Better off going to Barburrito not even gonna lie.
589,0,"If you want to pay for a virgin margarita for a regular priced margarita, by all means come to this place!"
1291,0,"Food was nothing special and food took a while to come out. We had the fried chicken - which lacked flavour nothing too great to be raves about. As sides we ordered the cauliflower and Brussels sprouts - which basically tasted like boiled vegetables which also lacked flavours. 
Overall wasn't super impressed, the only thing nice was really the inside of the restaurant with the aesthetics

Follow @cindysfood on instagram for more reviews!"
1783,1,"I come to 川味轩 occasionally and every time think to myself ""oh no looks like they closed down"" because of the state of disrepair of the storefront. 

Once inside, it's the same familiar servers and that awful plaid carpet. The prices haven't changed much over the years and neither has the menu, although I did notice the portions are smaller. I always get the lunch specials Kung Pao chicken, a tofu dish and spicy cold noodles which never disappoints. Lunch specials come with a soup of the day. 

Tasty, good value and a viable option if you are willing to relax your standards of cleanliness."
873,2,"The food was sooooo amazing! And the service was extremely good! I went there with my friend, and we both were extremely satisfied!"
663,1,"Terrific food, poor atmosphere, great customer service.  They deliver and are open during covid!"
821,1,"In a word, mediocre ! Always a hit or miss. Cramped ,over priced and not overly well trained servers. Stick to the basics when ordering & pass on the deserts. Try this place , you may get lucky but it's always a gamble. Sometimes it pays off , sometimes bust...."

36,1,"For what this spot is, it's fine. It's a King Street taco spot serving the King West crowd. Meaning, it's a bit overpriced (my dining companion asked me ""Are you SURE you only want 3 tacos...?"" while I was ordering) and a bit gimmicky for my liking. To be fair, I was coming off of having some fabulous tacos a couple of days ago at a little neighbourhood takeout where they mostly serve Latinx locals, AND I'm generally not a fan of anything fusion.

You grab a table and then line up to order and pay cafeteria-style. Then you go to the salsa bar for a very good variety of salsas and pico de gallo. Servers bring the food when it's ready. 

The food itself was fine, though don't order the grilled avocado if you don't eat dairy. It's literally just a grilled avocado. Even a healthy amount of pico de gallo and salsa couldn't save it. I found the tortillas really dry.

Atmosphere is cool and the people watching is pretty great. It was very busy with the after-work crowd. I don't think I'd return if I was craving tacos, but I would definitely hang out on their expanded sidewalk patio for a drink and some chips and guacamole."
1791,2,"Still one of my favorite original Chinatown establishments. I love the staff here - all bilingual and super friendly and treats you like family, especially if you speak Mandarin ;) Whenever I get cravings for traditional Chinese vegetarian dishes like lotus root, Chinese mushroom and fungus, mapo tofu, etc I come here. I also come here when I feel ""heritage-sick"" and need to reconnect with people who remind me of my family. Many customers here are regulars and know the staff personally. 

They will make all sorts of accommodations for dietary restrictions or special diets, such as vegan/vegetarian, e.g. mapo tofu usually is made with meat so remember to tell them at the beginning that you are vegetarian. 

Downsides are that they put way too much cornstarch, salt, and MSG in all of the mains. I definitely don't recommend the ""Bamboo shoots with Chinese mushrooms"" dish as everything was literally swimming in a broth of corn starch and the bamboo shoot was a bit stinky (as it should be, but just note that it is an acquired taste). I recommend the mapo tofu - it isn't that spicy at all! Also recommend the mixed vegetable stirfry, which contains Chinese black fungus (so yummy and crunchy!) and lotus root. This one has less corn starch and is on the lighter side.

Prices are low - most dishes are under $10 - and portion sizes are large. Rice/carbs do not come automatically with main dishes, so you do have to order these separately.

They accept card as well as cash.

Will be back!"
1713,1,"Noodles are what they do best, and that's what brought me back to this restaurant for the second time. It's a budget friendly spot to grab a bite in Chinatown. I really like the texture of the noodles here,  just a bit of chew, but still soft and lots of fun to eat. Everything else that goes with the noodles however doesn't quite stand out. Don't get me wrong, it's still delicious; an unhealthier version of what my mom would make. Maybe I've been spoiled by my moms cooking :p

The stir fried noodles are drowning in oil, and lots of msg used to add flavor to those cold dishes. It's hard to not like it, but so much regrets after. The portions are big but somehow I managed to clean the plate. As I wipe at my oil covered mouth from slurping the stir fried noodle, slowly realizing what I've done, my first instinct is that I should go on a juice cleanse tomorrow. However, as soon as I stepped out of the shop, I'm back to my normal self, thought of juice cleanse replaced by ""what should I have for dinner?"""
911,1,"Came here for brunch on Sunday and it was way off the mark. While the ambiance is nice, it was moderately loud and you may be asked to share a table with another group. That didn't bother us really -- the fail point was that they were out of so much stuff and the waitress didn't let us know before we spent a good ten minutes with the menu. No steak. Shoot.

The other failpoint was how their trout brunch menu item is basically like a few bits of fish and citrus. It's definitely not an entree and more of an appetizer. While the waitress did seem to communicate that a tad, I think we definitely expected something different.

The egg dish with the bread was pretty good and tasty and the winner, but portion-wise it also wasn't super filling, but the eggs were perfect. My goat meat focaccia sandwich was decent and tasty -- but I left the meal a bit hungry..I do think maybe we got unlucky with the amount of things they were out of and I do think the chef can cook...I just think the more appetizer-y items should be more clearly labeled and explained."
129,2,"$3.75 tacos! You can't go wrong! This little hidden gem is situated right across from Toronto Western Hospital. You can find street parking for free nearby. The tacos are made fresh and tastes very authentic! The staff are nice and chatty and it's a great place to have nice a quick dinner. I came with my partner and we ordered 5 tacos, quesadilla, and an apple soda for $30. This was the best $30 spent on tacos. If you like tacos, I would rate this higher than seven live tacos in Kensington as it's cleaner, more spacious, service is quick and food is amazing. 

My favourite was the pescado (fish) and carnitas (pork). The fish was cooked perfectly with a crunch and topped with good sauce. The pork was also nicely seasoned and dressed. They offer extra hot oil which isn't spicy (subjective) but the tacos tastes great without it."
215,1,"I got the 6inch shrimp burrito -- definitely not the best burrito I've ever had but it wasn't bad either. I enjoyed it but was disappointed when they said they didn't have any hot sauce?!! You also can't choose toppings either, I'm pretty sure all the burritos comes with the same thing (rice + peppers and onions) Again, tasted good didn't mind that at all but I think my extreme hunger made it taste a lot better, if that makes any sense. I probably won't be back but glad I got to try this place out!!! Maybe if I had tried the tacos my opinion would be different but you can def find better taco places I'm sure"

Came here for a quick lunch since I heard a lot about the Yonge and finch location of this noodle spot. We were quickly sat down and  able to place our order. 

We both got the Biang Biang Mien since it was recommended by the waitress and seemed to be the most popular item from others who came to this place. 

The noodles were interesting given the variety of different toppings that you wouldn't necessarily think go together, but I liked the mixed noodles concept. My biggest issue was that despite there being so many different toppings, the noodles tastes bland and didn't have much flavour to them. It seemed like the toppings weren't cooked enough to bring out the flavours or salted enough to help. 

Overall an interesting noodle concept but I don't think I'd return again."
1490,2,"Literally one of my favorite places we ate in Toronto! We stumbled upon this place in Chinatown and were not disappointed! 

The restaurant itself is small but they employees work quick to get food out fast! As you walk in, you can see the dumplings being made in the window and fried/steamed right there! The price was reasonable, the portions were huge, and the food was delicious! For two of us we definitely over ordered but could not decide what to eat and just got a bit of everything!

We ordered the fried pork dumplings, chicken fried noodles, and green onion pan cake! My favorite was the dumplings but you are at the House of Dumplings! Everything else was fantastic...we had to stop ourselves from licking the plates clean!

If in the area and visiting Chinatown, definitely check it out!!"
1401,1,"The food here is amazing. I understand why previous reviews mentioned it being an OG spot and authentic taste overall. They specialized in more FuZhou cooking but it's good cause it doesn't have the oily and greasy taste afterwards. We enjoyed everything we ordered and the portions were a great size for what we needed that day. They cook really good snow pea leaves, probably one of the best I've had in Chinese restaurants. So definitely no complaints about the food at all, it's totally worth it but CASH ONLY! 

The only reason why I'm giving it a 3 is because they don't have the best table service (which seemed to be the case in the Toronto Chinatown area). The waiting staff look really annoyed at you and the lack of hospitality is not what I'm used to when I go to restaurants. Maybe the workers are being overworked and not compensated enough, just don't let it rub you the wrong way if you want to try the food, it does come out fast and I did really enjoy it."
172,1,"After many friends had recommended this place, I decided to try it. Honestly, it was pretty overrated. The tortillas weren't great, and the guac was just alright. Glad I tried it because the place is cool, but the food is pretty forgettable."
1483,1,"You definitely come here for the dumplings and not the service. In typical Chinese fashion, the customer service here is nearly nonexistent. As we walked in, a waitress barked ""cash only"". Half way through our meal we were asked ""any more?"" and before we had a moment to discuss, we were given the bill. Finally, before we actually finished our food, a waitress started clearing our table. 

However, with that said, their dumplings are definitely their redeeming quality. They are handmade and fresh, from the wrappers to the fillings. They also offer a good variety; they have chicken, beef, pork, lamb, shrimp, and vegetarian dumplings. It is also a fairly cheap eat and it is easy to share. If you are willing to put up with poor customer service for good food, this is a decent option."
249,0,"In retrospect, it might have been a mistake to order a burrito from a taco joint.

But I'm a burrito guy; I would easily say it's one of my favorite foods ever, so if I spot it on a menu, I'm almost certainly ordering it.

And so it was that I found myself placing an order for a Carne Asada Burrito with all the fixins (including guacamole, which I paid extra for) on a recent Thursday evening.

After a wait of about 10 minutes, my burrito was ready to eat and I knew I had made a mistake with the very first bite. That first taste contained only plain iceberg lettuce and, worse still, it was almost ice cold. Yikes.

As I continued eating, I did begin to taste the Carne Asada and other ingredients and they are, to put it mildly, nothing special. There are virtually no bold flavors to be had here, and though I had asked for the spiciest level of heat, the burrito was surprisingly, disappointing bland.

The meat itself was chewy and unspectacular, too. The whole thing just tasted of a complete and total lack of effort, ultimately.

I might return to try one of Mi Taco's, uh, tacos, but I can't see myself ever ordering another burrito - especially when the far, far superior Burrito Boyz is just around the corner. (Heck, the nearby Mucho Burrito makes a better product!)"
258,1,"This place is a very busy spot downtown and it's the type of place you come and go or take it to go because of how tight the space is. I got the 3 type plate and they're okay. They're not bad but not amazing either (bear in mind, I eat a lot of tacos). Definitely worth trying out if you're already in the area but would I take an hr TTC ride to come here again? Nope."
306,1,"Friendly service and accommodated a baby no problem on busy Sunday evening.

I tried 3 types of tacos and the standout was the fish taco for me. I absolutely loved my margarita with the star anise spice in it. Must try!
The calamari was pretty weak, very small portions and fried batter falling off.

I would return to try a burrito, they looked massive."
1209,1,"I'm really not sure why this place has such great reviews, I found the food merely average. The interior reminds me more of the Southeast Asia budget ""backpacker"" vibe, ie partiers. It's certainly a part of the Thai experience but not really my thing.

Tom yum soup - this was pretty solid with vibrant flavors and a good kick. Maybe I've really lost spice tolerance but I was starting to drip before I was done with the cup...

Pad cha hett - mushroom stir fry. I got this with black rice just to try something new and it didn't quite fit the rest of the dish. If you get this, stick with the jasmine. The stir fry part was disappointingly bland though. It had a bit of a fennel taste to it, not sure what that comes from."
319,2,"I went back here and had the zucchini fritters and brisket burrito. Both were really good! I want to try the tacos again, but loved the burrito."
1576,0,"I recently checked out Hotopia with my friend because we wanted to try their sichuan pickled flavour fish soup.  You can choose different kinds of fish like basa fish.  We ended up with Tilapia.  The pot that came was big enough for 2 to 3 people.  My friend and I didn't manage to finish the pot.  The soup was actually pretty good.  It was more sour than spicy, but I liked the mix of flavours.  The Tilapia unfortunately was overly filled with bones.  I was surprised by this.  The staff didn't caution us about the bones, so we ended up spending the evening spitting them out, which was not my idea of an enjoyable meal.  
Maybe there is an alternative without bones.  I would like to go back and check out other dishes on the menu.  It's a fairly new restaurant, and was pretty packed when we were there.  But service was prompt."
937,0,"Extremely disappointing and mundane. 

Served frozen fish, the lasagna pasta was so overcooked it was actually falling apart and floury. There was not one element of any dishes that I actually enjoyed and while sitting here, I can't wait to leave so I can go to shoppers and get a frozen pizza..."
1347,2,"Shared the Squash Fritters (gra bong) with 3 people as appetizers. It was such a perfect start - crispy, fried to perfection, and not oily. The sweet dip enhances the taste and makes you munch on it again and again. For main, I had the Khao Soi, it was absolutely amazing. It's by far the best Khao Soi I've had in Downtown Toronto (I've tried PAI, Sabai Sabai, Sukhothai and Salad King). I love the soup, and the noodles blend perfectly well with it. The overall ambience is trendy and in an elegant, modern setting. There are plenty of seats (has a 2nd floor).

Khao San Road's portions is big - it's around the same price as the other Thai places but leaves you way more satisfied. My recommendation is to avoid the ridiculous line up at PAI and come here instead for equally (if not better) Thai food."
260,0,"Unfortunate to see such a great and authentic place go down in quality after growth in business. 

I loved Mi Taco when it first opened, it has a real authentic feel to it, amazing flavours of everything. 

I went back today after a couple years out of the neighbourhood and was so excited to go back, I was happy to see how busy they were and they had renovated. 

Unfortunately the quality of taco took a MASSIVE hit. The corn tortilla was mush by the time my food came to me. No seasoning at all. What a disappointing experience and loss in Toronto's Taco scene."
1688,0,"This place is not as good as expected because of the following reasons:

1. Shredded lamb with pancakes were dry and not fresh and portions for the lamb skewers were extremely small compared to some other tables. They should have equal portion sizes for all customers. 
2. The Western Chinese lamb rice is a strange combination of what seemed like sweet potato and the rice was clumped together. It did not taste good. 
3. The membership system is ridiculous as the normal prices have a huge difference for each item listed on the menu. They should provide members to have a discount over the total bill instead. 
4. My friend had food poisoning shortly after leaving the restaurant.

For these reasons, I would be reluctant to come back as there are many places that offer much better quality and portions."
798,2,"This restaurant had nice modern decor and comfortable seating. I went with a group of 9 people and they gave us a large table that was sectioned off so we had some privacy. 

Food wise I would say was ok, like 3.5/5 stars. This is because the portions seemed very small. The calamari appetizer tasted good, mushroom salad appetizer was good but not worth the price in my opinion, the complimentary bread was a bit burnt and too crunchy, the mozarella with tomato wasn't worth the price and was too simple ... For the main course I got the chicken (first item on the menu under secondi). It came with two large pieces of white and dark meat with potatoes, a grilled lemon on top, and some veggies. This was worth the price because of the amount of meat that was given. A few people at my table ordered the gnocchi which looked very plain when it arrived, but tasted ok. The gnocchi is the same price as the chicken and I would say the chicken is worth more. 

Overall, Iikely won't return often to this restaurant due to the portion sizes, however if I had to pick a few items to have again it would be the calamari appetizer and the chicken dish as the main course."
1873,1,"I give this restaurant three stars. I have been to Lai Wah Heen twice, most recently in January.

Lai Wah Heen is a upscale dim sum restaurant located on the second floor of the DoubleTree by Hilton, in downtown Toronto. The restaurant is spacious and bright, the staff is friendly and the service is excellent.

The dim sum is very good but there aren't many, if any vegetable options so it is quite heavy. Also, it doesn't seem very expensive but the price can increase rather quickly when you purchase a few of the higher priced dishes. The bill was higher when my wife and I went here in January than it was when we took our friend last year for her birthday. We particularly liked the crispy shrimp rolls served with sweet hawthorn sauce and the sticky rice filled with assorted seafood & meat, wrapped & steamed in lotus leaf. The spicy, sweet oyster sauce goes really well with the majority of the dim sum and the tea is excellent.

I will likely return to Lai Wah Heen sometime in the near future. I recommend this restaurant to anyone that likes dim sum and wants experience eating it in a high end setting. Three stars."
406,1,"We came here for Father's Day dinner on a slow Sunday. On google, it said the restaurant was closed on Sunday but apparently not ( they are open until 9pm), however when we called for a reservation they said they don't take reservation on Friday, Saturday and Sunday and that they were open till 8 pm. 

Restaurant was almost empty and after eating the food here we understand why. Service was okay, food was so-so! Nothing extraordinary that I can talk about nor I would return for."
382,0,"This is a tough one! As some of you may know I love Tacos! I kept hearing that Itacate was the best place to grab the most authentic tacos in Toronto and obviously I had to give it a try. This little spot is located on St.Claire W and it doubles as a Butcher shop. I walk in and it smells amazing! I love pork tacos and since I can cook all other tacos I decided to get the Carnitas and El pastor. I was so excited and 2 of the saddest looking tacos were brought over. 

Now, looks are not everything so I decided to take a bite. Even though the tacos were super plain I figured if the meat is super flavourful I won't need any sauces. The meats were very chewy, at one point I felt like I was eating leather. Most of the Pork had gooey fat all over it and I just wasn't a fan. I added cilantro, onions and the extra spicy sauce which helped with flavour but the meat was a big issue for me. 

Keep Eating,
Angela"
1339,1,"Well my wife and I finally got around to try the new location of Khao San Road on Charlotte St. I love the decor and design of this location very interesting use of space, at first I thought there was only maybe room for about 20 people but as our server took us around the corner there was more seating for about another 20 to 30 people. The ambiance is really loud here and the back tables are mainly long high tops so plan to share with other people. 

The service is ok nothing too over the top but I give them a benefit of a doubt cause it was lunch time and it was full house and the servers were all running around. It didn't take long to flag our server down for some additional napkins, however our water glasses were empty and no one came around to refill until we asked. 

The food was ok as well we had ordered the Garlic Tofu and Garlic Chicken to start. Both appetizers were very crunchy and crispy the garlic taste was a bit muted in my opinion both also come with a ramekin of the typical Thai sweet chili dipping sauce. Very crunchy exterior which locked in all the juice inside.

I ordered the Pad Gra Prao with beef add $1 and fried egg add $1 which is basically a dry curry with beef, red peppers, onions, red and green chili peppers and also a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg on top of white jasmine rice. I found that the beef was slightly too salty and too dry. Overall 3.5 / 5 for me. 

We also ordered the Khao Soi which is a soup noodle with egg noodles in a curry based soup. We opted to get the beef option for an additional $1. The presentation was really nice flavours were good slightly on the sweet side for my liking but when lime juice is added the flavour sort of balanced itself out. I think this is a 4 / 5 for me.

Overall just another Thai restaurant in the city that serves authentic Thai food. But didn't really blow me away.

FeiJai Out!"
462,1,"El Catrin is good! Located in the heart of Toronto's Distillery District, it prides itself on its traditional Mexican-style cuisine in a casual, yet oh-so-slightly-upscale atmosphere.

The interior is very tastefully decorated and the restaurant features a large outdoor patio equipped with giant space heaters for colder days.

I went to El Catrin for lunch and tried the Pepito torta while my companion had the Huevos Rancheros. The steak sandwich was really well marinated and super tender. Go for it! Oh, and we had the tableside-made guacamole with the tortilla chips (which turned out to be pretty excellent). You should go for that as well.

There aren't too many great options for food near Corktown/Distillery District, so give El Catrin a try next time you're around."
1046,1,"This Levetto location is located at Dovercourt and Sudbury, a few minutes away from the busy street of Queen West. I've tried the other Levetto locations before and decided to come back to this particular location as I was in the mood for pasta. I dropped by for lunch on a Thursday; the eatery was quite empty. The pasta I ordered was filing and service was friendly but the food was just forgettable this particular time. I found the pasta to be underwhelming, under seasoned, and overcooked. Unfortunately did not have a good experience here and will not be returning."
1678,2,"I am a soup fanatic. I have soup summer winter fall, no matter the season. 

This noodle place fulfills all my criteria: clean, CHEAP, beautiful gorgeous food (I love it when they set down the huge stone pot of soup in front of you), wonderful selection of soup base (I go for the original in the summer, and spicy during winter), they even give you SHRIMP as one of the side dishes, PHEW! LUX! 

Free noodle refill 
Awesome service 
Discount when you pay with cash 
Close to campus 
(Almost) no wait time.

I'm just waiting for them to get $$$ so they can expand to a bigger venue (and possibly franchise it so I can have my soup closer to home..)"
664,2,"Really nice guy running this restaurant and excellent food. All pasta is handmade, sauce home cooked. Yoy can tell this chef learned his trade in Italy"
755,1,"meeeeeeh.... I really wasn't all that impressed with this place. 

The decor and service were really good for sure. But the food was just OK. Considering how many amazing Italian restaurants there are in Toronto, I would not come back to this one. 

One thing that really surprised me was that the food was cold and didn't taste fresh. It sort of tasted like it had been reheated. 

The appetizers were fine but not amazing. The risotto, osso buco, and pasta did not live up to the hype -- just imo."
648,0,"We came here (King St location) Tuesday evening to take our guests from Vancouver to a nice dinner. Buca has been my favorite Italian spots in Toronto and has been my top recommendation for good restaurants in the city. We never once had a negative experience at Buca until last night. It was very disappointing to be in such a classy restaurant only to be treated poorly by their servers. We ordered charcuterie and pasta amongst the 5 of us. As we finished our dinner, we had told our server to pack up my bigoli pasta. As I picked up my takeout box, I realized it was not what I ordered. I quickly told the server that this was not mine and to my surprise, she yelled ""f*** off"" and stormed off in the kitchen. We were in shock as to why she responded this way. She returned shortly after, visibly disgruntled, and told me to stay put while the manager comes to talk to me. The manager arrives and simply tells me to wait while they make a new one for me to take home. She was not apologetic at all. Mind you, we had to wait 30 minutes for them to make the pasta again and as soon as I received it, they did not even acknowledge the fact that it shouldn't have taken that long. 

Mistakes happen but under no circumstances should servers be swearing at their customers. We are extremely confused as to what led to such aggresive remarks when we were the ones who had to wait 30 minutes to get our takeout. Definitely not going back after this incident. Servers were rude and ruined our evening."
803,2,"I booked a table at Carisma for NYE for a few reasons. First, I wanted something relatively low key since we had to head to the airport early the next morning. Second, I liked that they had their regular menu going on NYE and we weren't going to get a prix fixe meal; I find holiday ones like NYE and Valentine's Day usually disappoint. Third, it was walkable from our hotel, so we didn't have to contend with surge pricing or getting a ride (not sure how hard that is in Toronto, but it's a mess at home).

I'm not sure when the restaurant moved, the interior looks quite different from the pictures I saw in reviews. White tables, teal, velvet seating left it feeling much brighter that the old space. The acoustics aren't great, it was quite loud in the place which detracted from the romantic vibe they seemed to be trying to create.

We started out with cocktails and the burratina appetizer. He got a manhattan and I got an aperol spritz. They split the appetizer for us, which was very nice. The appetizer itself was good, but not outstanding. We had planned to each order an appetizer portion of pasta and a secondi, but our server felt that might be too much food. Instead, we opted to split the gnocchi as our primi, which again came split for us. It was creamy and rich and the gnocchi delicate, but I felt that it would have benefited from a but more salt. For my main, I got the sea bass and boyfriend got the filet. We also split a bottle of valpolicello. My sea bass came over veggies and potatoes and was quite delicious - my favorite of all the things I ate. Boyfriend like his dish, but felt like it had a bit too much char on it. 

For dessert, we had a glass of dessert wine and split the walnut tart. Both were quite good and to cap off a very filling meal, we had a glass of champagne at midnight with those that stuck around to ring in the New Year.

Service was attentive and knowledgeable. My only knock is that the pacing at the beginning of the meal was quite fast. We had barely finished the last bite of burratina when our gnocchi arrived.

Overall, I got what I wanted; a nice low key NYE and a good meal."
1240,1,"Heard a lot of hype about Kinka from friends who've been here previously and I wanted to love it but the volume level and food ultimately is what makes me give this place 3 stars. 

It's ABSURDLY loud, can't hear the person next to you talking; get ready to scream your order out. Most of the food was fine to not good but some of the things that I did find pretty delicious was the buta kakuni, miso black cod (albeit way too bones), and the yaki udon.

The karrage had too much batter and was hella dry, salmon oshizushi was bland, takoyaki and okonomiyaki was really w/e.

Basically I've had the same dishes better and at a reasonable volume at other places. Kinka is ultimately a turn up spot and if you treat it as such you won't be disappointed."
1440,2,"I was so worried this restaurant would be packed when I walked in on Saturday afternoon with a party of 8.  Thank god it was only half full.

The restaurant is on a 2nd level and somewhat small but not too crowded.  
The menu is extensive and you can get pretty much everything that's available in Markham.

I got:
1. Grilled chicken with spaghetti in black peppercorn sauce
- This was delicious.  The pasta was soft without being soggy and I think they melted a little of butter into it - yum.  
- The chicken was a good size and cooked perfectly.  
- The sauce complemented the whole dish, I would definitely reorder.
2. The beef skewers were great. But for $8 it was hefty for 4 skewers. We also found a small fly in our fruit salad. The waiter took off my lemonade ice tea to placate us and gave us another small bowl of fruit salad.  
3. Chicken fried rice. I shuddered a little when my boyfriend ordered this but it turned out very well overall.  The rice wasn't soaked in soy sauce and tasted like your usual chow fan with nice big chunks of chicken and eggs.

Overall this is a pretty good place to hit up if you're craving HK style food.

Service is Chinese (ie. not friendly but very efficient).
Tip: Waiter here speaks both Cantonese and English fluently (huge plus for anybody that's afraid of a language barrier)."
875,1,"The entrance was a bit hard to find, since there was no door / entrance off of the main street (where the restaurant's address was). You need to go into the Four Seasons Hotel area, turn left, and it's the last door by the fence (it's right across from the side entrance of Four Seasons Hotel). There's no obvious sign indicating where the restaurant is, until you actually get to in front of the door.

The food tastes good, but nothing too special. Portion sizes of the pasta are a bit on the small side. The vegetable sides are quite good and rightly portioned. Service is attentive and just like in any other higher-class restaurants."
989,2,"I've been to Grazie multiple time, and it's definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurant in the area. I always get their pizza (all the ones I tried so far have been very delicious), but my girlfriend likes to get their pasta. 

It's one of our go-to places whenever we're near the area. There are times when they get really busy (usually weekend dinner), so try to make reservations if you can. I believe they take reservations on weekends before 6pm."
1748,1,"I think I set my expectations too high for this place. Being chinese I keep hearing how good the dim sum was in toronto. I studied Yelp for a good while trying to find a dim sum place with good reviews. I looked at all different menus from different places and decided on this place. It was cash only so I had money exchanged after we crossed into Canada. We drove 2 hours (there was traffic) to get there. Had to pay for parking. It was a small hole in the wall place with literally 8 small tables total. I've been in many hole in the walls so no judging there...especially if the taste of the food was out of this world good! Not in this case...I must say that I've had better dim sum at a mediocre place in VA. MD by far has the best dim sum so if you're in the Rockville area, try out the dim sum there, both Cantonese and Taiwanese style! 
Anyways my family liked it but their not Chinese (my mixed family of Blasians) so to them, dim sum is dim sum. They did agree that we have better dim sum back home in VA/MD. 
The selection wasn't as great either but I did see the cook in the back making the dumplings fresh. My youngest son love dumplings and he commented that it wasn't as good as my mom's lol. Duh..of course grandma makes the best dumplings. 
The server was very nice but we wont be back. Dont believe the hype! Or at least not from here."
1806,0,"This is yet another restaurant in Chinatown which specializes in homemade dumplings and Northern Chinese cuisine. 

I came here only because Yummy Dumplings was closed for lunch on Wednesday, so I ended up here to satisfy my dumpling cravings. 

I ordered the pork & chives dumplings (boiled) which was so so. The skin was thicker than I'm used to but still acceptable & you get 16 dumplings for $7.99. The XLB soup dumplings came next. It was presented in the usual bamboo steamer and you get 10 small bite size pieces. It certainly wasn't my favourite because the skin was thick & some seemed under cooked. The pork filling was okay but the soup content wasn't very consistent. Some were not replete with soup when biting into them and overall wasn't very satisfying. Also it's typically served with some fresh ginger on the side to make your dipping sauce but they don't here. Maybe their Xian style dishes are what they are best known for but it certainly wasn't the dumplings."
1568,2,"Got there on a Friday around 12:30 so I waited about 15 minutes for a table for 2. Hubby and I split a mega special Lanzhou beef noodle with the picked daikon radish side and jellyfish side.

Broth is perfectly seasoned (I asked for them to make it spicy and to add green onions and coriander/cilantro). Broth may seem bland to a lot of non-Asians but it was just right because of eating it with aforementioned side dishes. 

The noodle makers scared the $hit out of me when I was waiting in line because they didn't start pounding the noodles until about 10 minutes in. 

Paying bill is easy, multiple card readers on hand."
1018,1,"My friend recently moved to the Junction area and we decided to try this place out. Unfortunately, we didn't have a great experience. I was the first to arrive and there were quite a few empty tables on a Friday evening. The hostess said that she'd seat me when the rest of my party arrived (understandable). 5 minutes later, another customer came in (she was an older woman) and said she was waiting on 2 other people. The hostess sat her down immediately, which was a little weird to me but I didn't want to cause a scene and didn't ask about it. When the rest of my party arrived, it took them forever to seat us as it was getting busier and they were slightly understaffed. 

The food itself was good but the portions were small for the appetizers. We ordered the burrata and octopus to share. The burrata salad tasted fresh but for $20 it wasn't worth it in my opinion. Likewise, the octopus was chopped up into tiny pieces and served with potatoes. We each had about 2 tiny bites of octopus. However, the most disappointing part of the meal was the main. All four of us got the duck ragu pappardelle and I was surprised that it came with tomato sauce. The pappardelle itself tasted fresh and they were generous with the duck but too bad they were drenched in tomato sauce. I've had amazing ragu sauce at other places before and this was overwhelmingly disappointing despite it being one of their best seller. I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon."
1786,1,"TL;DR Delicious Chinese food but not exactly authentic Sichuan. 

We ordered takeout on a Saturday night - green beans with pork, gong bao chicken, and mapo tofu. 

The green beans with pork was a standout, the beans tasted fresh while nicely fried at the same time, the dish could have used slightly larger pork crumbs though. 

The gongbao chicken was definitely not authentic - it was a bit saucy compared to the normal version and the chicken pieces were larger than normal. It was not spicy at all and maybe a bit sweet. It was still tasty. 

The mapo tofu was also a standout - a bit spicy and very flavourful.
 The portions were large and generous. We can't comment on cleanliness or service since we ordered delivery via DoorDash. 

One star off since neither of us felt like it was authentic Sichuan cuisine - too much cornstarch and a tad too sweet. It was tasty nonetheless. Side note, we both had poor stomaches a few hours after dinner. Can't tell if it was from the meal, just figured we'd add in case."
1879,0,"First of all, let's be clear. Growing up in Asia, I have tasted the best of the best! So I'm not easily impressed by Chinese restaurants overseas. Lai Wah Heen came with rave reviews by Canadians, so I thought I'd check it out and see how it measured up to restaurants in Singapore and Hong Kong.

Verdict - Lai Wah Heen, which is supposedly 5-star here in Toronto, has dim sum that any 3-star restaurants in Singapore (eg. Mid-tier Wah Lok would win hands down) and Hong Kong can easily beat.

The presentation was nice. The taste profile of some of their offerings were decent, but there was only ONE stand-out dish that wowed - and that was the lava custard buns, which were flawlessly executed.

My biggest complaint was the skin on the steamed dumplings. The skin was too thick (especially the lobster dumpling) and chewing through it was laborious.

Overall, it's not worth the price."
863,2,"Got the ahi tuna dish. Really tasty and fresh. The service was amazing too. Had a bottle of wine with friends and it was really good too.

Dark lighting, fine dining... posh place

Bread and dessert were really good too!"
928,1,"I ordered the Siciliana pasta. For the prices that everything is on the menu, it's definitely worth it. We all got a pretty big portion. In terms of taste however, it didn't really blow me away. 

Although the food took quite some time to get to us (30 minutes) the service was great. I had this waitress from Ireland who was quite nice. When I wasn't sure of which wine to get, she also brought me tasters. 

Overall, it's a good place for fairly cheap Italian food but it didn't blow my socks off."
1187,1,"Some hits and many misses; 
Always sad when slow/ inattentive or simply bad service ruins great dishes. However, the setting, the space, and the wine list are great. 

The food: although executed greatly leaves something to be desired in flavour. Simple ingredients are supposed to speak for themselves here mostly, however more ""cooked"" dishes lacked savoury or original flavours that would make you go back for specific dishes. 

The good:  Cacio e pepe is great- am I running back for it anytime, maybe. 
The disappointing: Avoid the Branzino (sea bass) if you have a problem with bones- they make no effort in deboning it before serving. 

The main issue here is service. It was exceptionally slow; had to call the staff several time for refills, orders, more wine, where's our food... etc. T
he timing between each course needed to be shortened but half if not more. I don't think they want you sitting there for 3 hours without dessert even. There were too many loooong pauses during meal staring at an empty table waiting for another round of dishes. 

With lots of great Italian options in the city I would definitely consider it more like a wine bar with a few nibbles rather than a full fledged hearty meal."
1071,0,"This place has been on my list of must-try restaurants in the Yonge-Eg area for quite some time (mostly because of all the high Yelp reviews). However, I was pretty disappointed with my experience. Cleanliness is a really big deal to me, and the restaurant did not feel very clean. There were a LOT of flies buzzing around my table, to the point that I had to swat my hand in between every single bite and was afraid one would fly into my mouth (ew!). The bread was cold, and the pasta was mediocre and at a higher price point. The waiter could see me constantly waving my hand to get the flies out of my face and made no comment. I was not impressed."
1575,1,"Dining here on a Saturday night was a 30 mins wait on the waitlist for a group of four. There was a small waiting area so it wasn't terrible but heads up, the place is pretty noisy

We ordered the ""boiled clams"", the ""Sichuan Picked Flavoured Beef in soup"", and their iced plum green tea

The clams were def a hit and a very reasonable price ($8) we really enjoyed the flavour and quality of the dish

The beef soup sadly was a ""miss"", the beef shavings were decent quality but the taste wasn't enjoyable. Too many peppercorns were left in the dish and slightly tasted off ( I'm unsure if stale or...) 

Tbh the spice level is manageable and not over the top, I just found the flavour to be subpar for Sichuan soup dishes 

The plum green tea isn't a fave either, extremely sweet and diluted (tastes like a watered down freezie )"
1055,1,"La Vecchia is a cute restaurant with great ambiance near Yonge & Eglinton. It is filled with wooden tables and twinkle lights. 

The service is great. We didn't make a reservation for dinner but snagged a spot at the bar. Both the bartender and our server checked in with us frequently. Our water was constantly filled up and we were asked if we desired further drinks throughout the experience. 

While the food was good, it was simply average. We had the penne alla vodka (gluten free) and the capricciosa pizza. Unfortunately, only a handful of the pasta options could be made gluten free, and none of the pizza could be made gluten free. This was fairly limiting. 

There are various delicious Italian restaurants in the area and unfortunately this one simply didn't stack up (both in taste and gluten free options). I would certainly come back for drinks (I had a delicious Aperol spritz) but would likely not come back for the food."
597,1,"Coming here for the 3rd time because I was craving pizza. We got a seat right away around 7pm on Friday on the lower floor. Nice candlelit tables, dim, however very loud and we had to shout across the table to hear each other.

Went with the basic margarita pizza and fries. Despite my food coming fast, my pizza was cold :( Probably waited on the counter too long because my bf's pizza was warm. Thin and crunchy, I had a salt craving that day lol.

The fries tasted like layz fries (oily and crunchy) but airier. Comes with light garlic sauce.

Decided to try a panna cotta for dessert (blood orange for 10.99) I'm sad to say this is one of the worst desserts i've tasted, just wasn't my cup of tea. I thought it would be a custard consistency considering it's heavy cream based, but it came in a cup instead. And it wasn't creamy nor sweet- it was really sour! The orange froth on top was okay but then you get to orange chunks in the middle that's really tangy, and at the bottom you have olive oil?? My taste buds did not like the combination of olive oil and orange. Sorry, but i couldn't finished it :/"
1386,2,"Finally had the opportunity to come here after hearing all the great things about this place. Very upscale and posh vibe. 

Servers were descriptive with the menu and was very at tentative. Made great recommendations.

Oysters tasted fresh. Table side Cesar salad was great. Ribeye was well cooked but still tough and chewy. Wasn't particularly well seasoned which is why the side salt and sauces were provided. Could have lived without the rapini and mushroom. Bone marrow is a must. 

Independently a very great experience but tainted from just coming back from Japan."
416,0,"Worst service ever, was yelled at by the head cook when we asked if take out was available because he was too busy and its not worth his time for a small order. His words.  Avoid this place, much better options ""Mariachi"" on Yonge street 2 mins away.  Playa Cabana downtown."
1423,0,"One of the few restaurants I was most excited for but was left the most disappointed... Based on the reviews and pictures I came here with high expectations, unfortunately my experience was very underwhelming.

My friends and I ordered the crispy octopus tacos, hakka brown wontons, torched tamari glazed beef carpaccio, sichuan braised beef and the whole fried giggie trout. My table all agreed that the tacos were delicious and the best out of everything, and since this was the first dish brought to us we had very high hopes for the rest of our dinner. 

The rest of our food were just mediocre - it wasn't BAD but it wasn't to die for either. It honestly tasted like stuff we can make at home, which some people may not mind but my friends and I were expecting the fusion tastes to be more noticeable and long the lines of tastes we've never tried or experienced. The flavours/tastes didn't compliment each other or stood out to us at all, so we didn't really experience the ""fusion"" in any of the dishes except for the tacos. 

Some of the criticism agreed by my entire table for certain dishes were:

- the braised beef tasted exactly like the beef in pho, which is weird because the seasoning is completely different
- the wontons were a bit too salty 
- the trout was a bit too oily for us
- not enough sauces on the beef carpaccio, so it was too plain

Not only were the tastes not there, the portions were ridiculously small for the price (especially the tacos), aside from the trout. We usually order the same amount of food for 4 girls elsewhere and never finish - we finished all of the food here and were still hungry! Our final bill was $200 on the dot after taxes which is supposed to be AVERAGE I guess... but not worth it at DaiLo because we weren't full/satisfied. I feel like we could've spent the same amount elsewhere and gotten a better experience with food and actually be full afterwards. 

Despite the food not meeting our expectations, service was outstanding and impeccable. Our server was very patient with us and answered all of our questions, and explained each dish that came out beautifully. Our waters were always filled, and dishes were cleared quickly so our table was never too crowded. It was very quick to get his attention too when needed. 

Would I come back? Most likely not. I applaud DaiLo for trying with the the whole fusion scene but it just didn't work for us. The ""fusion"" additions they tried weren't enough to make most of the dishes stand out to us, the dishes tasted far too familiar at home... Sucks because we all really wanted to like this place!"
1626,0,"I was craving soup dumplings and this restaurant has such good reviews that I just had to come here. It's a tiny restaurant down some steps, so it might be hard at first to find if you don't know what you're looking for exactly. There isn't a ton of seats, so if it's busy, you might need to wait for a table.

The restaurant itself could use a huge facelift. The washrooms were dirty and very small. The whole place just feels outdated - minus the tables and chairs. I came on a busy Saturday night but was seated fairly quickly. They cleaned my table before I was seated but the dish cloth they used to wipe the table was definitely used.. my table just smelled like a used dish cloth, sadly.
There were also a TON of mosquitos. We were seated right in front the of door, so perhaps this could be why.. but the most odd thing is that they would just drop onto our table and food, and almost die or stop moving instantly. Not sure what was going on.. but it ruined my appetite. 

ONTO THE FOOD: the most important reason why I'm reviewing! We ordered the Juicy Pork Dumplings (soup dumplings), fried shrimp & pork dumplings, & chive pancakes. The soup dumplings were just okay. The filling wasn't as flavourful as other ones that I've tried from other places. It was missing something but I can't figure out what it is. The pancakes were really good, and I wish I ate more but they were dripping I grease, so I couldn't eat more than 2. I didn't have any of the fried dumplings but my boyfriend said they were very greasy as well. We actually had to go get a drink from a bar close by just to get rid of the greasy feel in our mouths.

I honestly wouldn't come back here myself. A lot of other people gave this place high reviews so I'm not sure if I just had a bad experience or not. But the greasy food and mosquitos flying around or dropped dead in front of us wasn't acceptable."
1529,0,"Inattentive staff, over cooked food. Noodle break right apart because it's so overdone."
13,1,"My friend and I decided on Mexican food for dinner and this popped up as nearby where we were at the time, Yorkville/Annex area. As we walked in, immediately we're greeted and seated in a tight space for 2. The menu was explained to us and water was given, then we were left for a few minutes to decide. 

We decided on salsa fresca & chips, chicken enchiladas suizas and short rib emmoladas along with a bottle each of corona and negra cervezas.

Salsa fresca and chips arrived first, the tomato salsa was delicious, the morita chile seemed to have been grilled before it was mashed together with tomatoes and red onions and went well with the crispy chips. (If you come for anything at all, this would be it and definitely skip the guac as it didn't seem appetizing.)

My friend and I shared the chicken enchiladas suizas and short rib emmoladas, while tasty, I could've gotten it somewhere else for cheaper. 

Because of how tight the space is, I was able to look around at what the other dinners ordered and the the tacos seemed to be more popular, so will have to come back and try those.

We also ordered alfajores, which at $8 for 2 was just meh."
317,0,"I came last summer and had an amazing dinner, I remembered the tacos to be rich in flavour and super affordable which was a big stand out to me since a lot of other taco places that charge upwards of $7/8 per taco. I dare to say that this WAS my favourite taco place at the time.

I came back this month for the first time in nearly a year and things were a lot different. For Tacos, I ordered the Biztec de Carne and the Carnita and they ended up tasting exactly the same, which was disappointing and weird since they have a lot of different ingredients altogether. Also there seemed to be a lot of liquid in the taco filling because halfway through eating one of my tacos it fell apart due to the moisture. Also, in all of the tacos, there seemed to be this weird crunchy/salty/sweet ingredient that I couldn't tell what it was. It was really odd, and gave the tacos a weird flavour/texture profile. This was not the same as what I ate a year ago, and they seemed to be more expensive than I remembered.

The one thing that stayed consistent however was their amazing Churro Sundae - everyone in the restaurant seemed to be ordering this. Their Churros were seasoned and cooked perfectly, and the caramel ice cream pairs perfectly - its one of the best churro desserts in the city in my opinion, and would come back just for this."
645,0,"Service was horrible. I cant explain with the words. We waited a lot for everything. The bill came 15 minute after I asked. Pasta was extremley small but i cant understand this shit. Why dont you put more pastocon the plate ? Pasta is super cheap thing also there is no cheaper pasta than $22. Like just put some more that than i can say it worth! 

Terrible experience I dont reccomend to people go there."
907,1,"I reallyyyy wanted to like this place, I was truly excited to try it. 
The ambiance, the decor and the service were all great. But the food was just average for me. 

I really loved the caffè con zabaglione (espresso with sweet italian custard ) It was honestly the highlight of our meal. The Italian Custard gave it a wonderful sweet taste, similarly to how coffee with bailey's would taste. 

Unfortunately they didn't have many Gluten Free options or Vegetarian options, but we managed. 

I ordered the strapazzate dish (pulled mixed farm eggs, burrata & black truffles ) While to some it might seem like a delicate egg dish, to me, it tasted quite bland and lacked flavour. There was essentially no seasoning in the egg. All you tasted was plain egg with burrata cheese. 

I might come back here for a pastry and a coffee, but not for a meal"
341,2,"Best staff and best tacos!!!!  Mikaela and Myles were just EXCELLENT and ensured that I (a person who tastes soap in cilantro) was well taken care of.  Come here on a Wednesday night, like we did, and you will get the most out of the excellent customer service. 
A+++!"
79,2,"Amazing!! Family run, authentic, delicious food, competitive pricing and great portions! Love that they offer courtesy chips and homemade salsa! They earned our business and we will definitely be returning. Mexitaco has lost our business. Overpriced and portions are a rip off. This is way better! You won't regret it!"
487,2,"Having lived in the states enjoying variety of authentic Mexican food, after moving back to Toronto, I have been fairly disappointed and greatly missed real Mexican food. Coma y Canela saved me. Their food is purely authentic. They make everything home made, even the Mole sauce. You will never be disappointed eating here. The only thing is there are not enough seating and you may have to wait for seats if you visit during busy lunch/dinner time."
548,1,"It's pretty good Mexican food, and the atmosphere is cute. I sometimes come here for lunch when I am at work. Service is friendly and the food is decent. I've ordered the tacos, nachos and the churros. Can't go wrong."
927,0,"The best thing about this place is the price of the food. Me and my wife went for dinner about an hour and a half before thier closing time on a Saturday night the place was less than half full. We were seated at a table that felt like it was a common walk way by the front door so requested if we could be moved and the waitress refused to move us saying she couldn't offer up a four person table to two people, even though there were plenty and the place wasn't even half full. 

On to the food: 
Bruschetta: bread used was good nice and toasted not overly hard. The tomatoes were tasteless and bland which ruins this dish no matter how good the bread is. Did not taste like bruschetta at all.

My wife ordered the rigatoni Bolognese with a rose sauce. She did not enjoy it at all saying it was watered down sauce with chunks of bland tomatoes. 

I had the penne ala vodka with meatballs as a sub for the bacon my dish was not bad  food came out piping hot, sauce was decent meatballs were small and tasteless.

If you're on a budget, don't care about good service or food quality then this is the spot for you!"
808,2,"Fine Italian dining. Valued accordingly, but you certainly get what you pay for and the service was fantastic (as was the food). At our table the wild boar ragu pasta, sea bass and risotto were favourites. Our selections of Osso buco and delicate fish fillets perfectly prepared and flavored. The restaurant filled up as show time approached but we hardly noticed - not overly noisy despite being full by the time we departed. The food and service were both exceptional. Carisam is our number one choice for Italian food in Toronto. Sophisticated, elegant and classic. Love this place!"
54,0,"$16 dollars for the worst burrito bowl/platter ever, are you friggin kidding me. Maybe because it was take out but that's hardly an excuse. The portion size is just pathetic, and the chicken was pretty dry even though it was fairly flavorful. It's not value for the money at all, highly disappointing. Go look at the photo and tell me if that's worth it. At least try a little."
1461,1,"The interior here is spacious and clean, which makes it a good place for happy hour or business meals. The servers were quick, but it took some effort to get their attention sometimes. 

We had the dan dan noodles, pork belly over rice, XLB, and pan fried dumplings. Although this was a mix of appetizers and dimsum, the amount of food was just enough for us. My favorite was the dan dan noodles, especially with the hot chili oil for those that like spice. 

Overall I had a good dining experience but was a bit disappointed with the dimsum selection. I was looking for a good dimsum restaurant in Chinatown and, for being labeled a dimsum restaurant, there wasn't that much."
636,1,"The pasta is really good. You can tell it's homemade once you take a bite. However, prices are quite high with portion sizes small. I ordered the duck pasta and felt I wanted more pasta but I guess it's filling but I don't think it's worth the price. I love my desserts but all their desserts were over $15 so I passed. The service was good and attentive.

They do not do separate cheques. Therefore, if you come with a large group be prepared to grab your calculators so you can split the bill easier. I'm a little annoyed that the host never checked me in with my open table reservation which resulted in a warning email from Open Table for a No Show. He did resolve it after the phone call but it was quite inconvenient to have to call the restaurant to have them fix the problem."
1773,0,"Last week, I decided to get take out from a nearby restaurant. They said it would take twenty minutes, so I decided to walk around instead of waiting at the restaurant. I had killed some time and by the time I had looped around, I thought hey maybe I can grab one of my favorite treats as dessert. Dynasty was right there, so I went upstairs, proceeded to the counter, looked at their priceless* dim sum menu and ordered one order of the steamed egg yolk custard buns.

I said priceless with an * because I wanted to explain that it didn't have a price next to the items... Not because there menu is super precious. Boy did I ever experience sticker shock. Yes, I do remember Dynasty is over priced and the food is average here. But when I paid over $10 for three tiny buns...I couldn't help but think: didn't I pay just four dollars for three of these, but slightly larger ones, at Rol San a few weeks ago? 

Okay, so maybe the quality is why it's priced higher, I thought. So after eating amazing Indian food for dinner, I dug into the custard buns. The filing is kinda dry... Atop of this, there's some weird film/coating around the ""custard""/yolk. I assume it's edible, because it's in all three, and I ate it. But if I had to compare it against other custard buns that I've had... I'd much prefer a creamy custard instead of something dried up. I don't think of custards as something dried up ever.

There was a time when the buns were good here... Years ago. Its a shame because the other items in the menu here really are average and over priced."
168,2,"A great spot for some tacos!

Been meaning to go here for a while and after 1hr in Costco followed by the lovely prime time traffic back to King West it was time!!

Firstly, defo aim to go when its sunny and sit outside, the outdoor area is nice and if you can get in the little secluded section you may never leave.

On the tacos i had the Haddock Fish Taco, the Steak and Chorizo and the Chicken ones - I warn now do not be as greedy as me 3 of these tacos was too much of course i ate them but 2 is well enough.

The fish one was only ok but the Steak Taco was one of the best I have had...the chicken also is a treat so go for them 2.

All the ingredients felt fresh and each taco came with different toppings to compliment the meats which which they did perfectly!

Absolutely worth a go if your a taco fan, just don't be surprised when you accidentally spend over 100$

PS - The cocktails are unique and amazing, the Pina-Mojito is a must try ...hmmm maybe this is why i cleared 100$

PPS - Get chips and Guac, its good and free refills on the chips."
1793,0,"Inauthentic and bland. Red flags: No classic numbing spice flavor. Missed the spot on 2 signature dishes so I won't be coming back. 

The cold noodles appetizer was had noodles that were thick and tasted like spaghetti and old lard. No complimentary contents either--you can usually expect some sesame oil or thinly chopped black fungus or something but this was a low effort fail completely. 

The ""mouth watering chicken"" which is a cold chicken dish was sitting in a pool of chili oil and soy sauce (which is normal) but completely lacked flavor and spice--it should carry the sweet flavor of cooking wine, the saltiness of soy sauce and have the savory ""ma la"" numbing spice that makes your lips and tongue tingle. The only thing resembling the classic dish was the fact that the chicken was rather bony and gristly. I had to ask for more hua jiao (si chuan pepper) oil to make it edible 

I'm horribly disappointed and the two dishes cost me $14. It's overpriced at this rate. The decor is austere but rundown (fake wooden footbridge leading into banquet style restaurant that looks tatty) and I guess the fact it was empty on a Friday evening at 9 was highly suspect. Please just go to Si Chuan house cuisine if you're looking for anything nearly close to spicy"
1744,1,"We have been here for takeout a few times here. Remember its CASH ONLY so pack those 20 bills. I really liked their dim sum sampler, with classic dumplings like shrimp and seafood. I would recommend the dim sum sampler over their dishes."
1737,0,"Good take-out place with well-priced specials each day for the price of $4.99 before tax.  Went here on a whim and ordered the Sunday specials of eggplant tofu on rice and BBQ chicken leg.  You get what you pay for.  Greasy more than flavourful.  It is delicious in comforting way.  The hot and sour soup was plenty hot but not sour enough.  Service was brisk and abrupt.  Seems to be frequented by students and there's a bit of a language barrier.

Not particularly motivated to try it again in the future no matter what the price point could be."
1044,0,"Overrated non-authentic Italian food. Their location gives them business. 

Menu is interesting but not up to standard. Ambience is okay."
424,2,"If you're in the mood for authentic Mexican this is the place.  Best Margaritas, my favourite guacamole is blue cheese with walnuts: cactus one is also pretty divine.  Amazing mexican music & totally worth every penny."
275,1,"2.5/5 stars. Delicious gourmet tacos, but pricey.

Food: 4/5. Everything I tried was delicious. We started with chips + 3 dips which I would highly recommend.  It came with tomato salsa, corn salsa and guacamole. I also really enjoyed the flavour of my tacos. I got:

- Achiote Chicken. My least favourite but still decent. 
- Crispy Cotija. Basically fried cheese, which you can never go wrong with. 
- Carnita. Pork taco with amazing fixings. This was my absolute favourite. 

We also got a pitcher of one of their daily special drinks, which was a pineapple beer. The glass came rimmed with HEAPS of salt which everyone at my table hated - salt & beer? 


Service & Atmosphere: 2.5/5. Loud & dark space. Hipster in style. Server was nice but visited our table very rarely. There were 5 of us at the table being billed separately. All of our bills were out of order. I had a taco missing from my bill, which got added on to someone else's bill, etc. When we tried to say something to the server she just handed us the debit machine. We ended up figuring out her billing mistakes ourselves and paid each other back the appropriate amounts. 


Value for Money: 2/5. This is where it really falls flat for me. Each MINI taco is about $6.00 each. They can be finished in 2 bites. That's ~$3.00 per bite. They are mini tacos too so you'll need a few of them to feel satisfied."
1143,2,"Great dining experience. Make sure to get a reservation. Excellent service,  excellent food! Rainbow Trout was divine! And tartuffo dessert... sublime! Couldn't have had a better meal. Everything was sensational!!"
1537,2,"I think I have found a favorite place for food if you're on a budget, and also as a student! Located around Dragon City Mall at Chinatown, this is a popular quick eats place for delicious soup dumplings as low as $2.99 for 6! There are limited seats inside, and by the window, however since it's a quick meal, people tend to leave pretty quickly. Their menu offers a variety of soup dumplings, rice and also juicy fried buns. One thing I don't usually see in other Shanghai restaurant is pan fried versions of soup dumplings, so I definitely had to make an order of that. After ordering with the cashier, you will get a beeper that will ring when youre order's ready.

The food came fairly quickly after ordering. The soup dumplings are what youd get at regular Shanghai restaurants; super juicy and tasty!! I was honestly so surprised how delicious they were as I was skeptical at first due to the low price. The fried juicy buns were a bit small compared to other places, but for the price, you cant complain, and plus they were also very juicy inside as well. The pan fried soup dumplings were also surprisingly juicy as well as I was worried the heat from pan frying them would take it away. All in all, we ordered 4 things and the bill came up to be $16!"
1834,1,"The barbecue meat here is really good, juicy and tender. I normally get the lunch boxes here, and it's very hit and miss here.
I made the mistake of coming here 1.5 hours before they closed. They ran out of veggies, but still had plenty of meat left.

If you get the young dude cutting your meat, you're gonna get much less meat in your box. he's pretty stingy. and I've gone here 3 times, and every time he cut my meat, I got either bad cuts, or very little.

I've gotten roasted duck rice before, and he gives you the bones and rib area, with one piece of breast so you have one piece with meat.

Today I got 2 boxes, No veggies were left. I got 6 pieces of bbq pork and 5 pieces of roasted pork. and whole box load of rice. was so disappointed! barely any toppings, and they had plenty of meat left!! not like they were running out.

argh! the only part I can't complain is it's 6.50 a box and comes with either soup or a can of pop.

Pro tip, come early, otherwise don't come. and hope it's not the young dude cutting your meat."
235,0,"Totally disappointing - everything is definitely on the over-seasoned/extremely salty side. Or totally BURNT! 

The chips we were served were totally burnt and we were told they were the batch of the day and there was nothing they can do about it. (Check pic)

The chips were followed by a totally burnt batch of corn- were not talking grill marks here, crust black corn. We were told that how it's severed (no it's not, we've been here before!). Is there no one to check what comes out of the kitchen??

To add insult to injury chewed on an avocado pit in the guacamole. 

Hosting and service were another issue. Extremely disappointing experience all in all. Fails at all basic hospitality and restaurant standard."
